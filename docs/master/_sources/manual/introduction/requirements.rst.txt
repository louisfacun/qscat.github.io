Requirements
************

To use QSCAT, you need QGIS, which is a free and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software. You can download different versions of QGIS from the `QGIS website <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_ (see for the versions below). Ensure that your system meets the system requirements of QGIS: a standard PC with at least 4GB of RAM running on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.

Since QSCAT is just a plugin of QGIS (not standalone software), if you meet the system requirements of QGIS, QSCAT should run fine on your system.

QGIS versions
-------------

Currently, QSCAT is being tested on the following versions of QGIS:

* **QGIS 3.22.6**: Latest stable version of QGIS as of the time we started the development of QSCAT. 
* **QGIS 3.34.5**: Latest stable version of QGIS as of the time: April 1, 2024.
* **QGIS 3.36.2**: Latest development version of QGIS as of the time: April 1, 2024.

Although QSCAT will probably run on any version of QGIS version 3 and above, we recommend using the versions listed above to avoid any compatibility issues.
