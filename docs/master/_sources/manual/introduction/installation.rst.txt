The QSCAT plugin can be installed in two ways: by using the QGIS plugin repository (recommended) or by installing from a ZIP file. The steps to install the plugin are similar regardless of the operating system (Windows, Linux, and Mac OS). The following sections provide detailed instructions on how to install the plugin using both methods.
